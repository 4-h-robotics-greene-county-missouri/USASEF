These are Google SketchUp models of various components that make up the robot's computing, communication, and sensor systems.
They are fairly accurate to real size, but some models are slightly warped from real dimentions. This is due to improper 
tape-measurer use.

final_assembly.skp is all of the components added in a single image, plus a rectangular solid that will enclose all of the 
components at once.
